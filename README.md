* üëãYo yooo, I'm Mert! 24 years old, building software and obsessing over Fixed-Income and ETFs like a boomer trapped in Gen Z.

* üè† **Hailing from Ankara, Turkey!** ü§ò

* üéì I graduated in Linguistics, where I explored constructed languages, theoretical linguistics, Haskell, and some NLP with Python.

* üíª My current prog. lang. stack is -> C# (my one true love), JS/TS-React (because I love fancy UX), Python and sometimes Haskell[rare]. Exploring Rust and Scala.

* ‚ù§Ô∏è Why .NET? Comfy like sweatpants. Stable like [German bonds](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=TVC%3ADE10Y) or [Japanese Interest Rates](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=ECONOMICS%3AJPINTR). Fast enough to pretend I know systems programming. Perfect for lazy geniuses (that‚Äôs me)

* üí¨ I live in Windows 11, occasionally summon Ubuntu WSL, and yes‚ÄîI can use Linux or FreeBSD, but why suffer when I could nap?
* ü¶• I live in JetBrains Rider/Fleet or Microsoft Visual Studio for anything, I tried Vim/Helix/Litexl once and decided life is too short to remember 47 keybinds to exit a file.
